# Hi there 👋

I'm André, a passionate software developer with 4+ years of experience working with software. I'm curious about how things work and enjoy building solutions that make a difference.

## What I Love
- 🚀 Building web applications with modern technologies
- 📝 Sharing my expiriences through my [blog](https://andre-izarra.netlify.app/es/)
- 🎮 Really like game development but just as a hobby

Lastly I've been using [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) to track my progress in topics that I'd really like to improve.
